AI-First Quality Management System (QMS) Event ModuleThis project is a full-stack web application developed for the Round 3 evaluation. It is a provisional-level QMS module designed for a life science company, allowing users to create, track, and gain AI-powered insights on quality events.Technology StackCategoryTechnologyFrontendReact (Vite), Redux Toolkit, AxiosBackendPython, FastAPI, SQLAlchemyDatabaseSQLiteAI ModelGoogle Gemini 1.5 FlashSetup InstructionsBackend SetupNavigate to the backend directory:cd backend
Create and activate a Python virtual environment:# Create the environment
python -m venv venv
# Activate on Windows
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
Install the required dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your API Key:Create a file named .env in the backend directory.Add your Google Gemini API key to this file:GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
Frontend SetupNavigate to the frontend directory:cd frontend
Install the required dependencies:npm install
Running the ApplicationYou will need two separate terminals to run the application.Start the Backend Server:In a terminal, navigate to the backend directory and activate the virtual environment.Run the following command:uvicorn app.main:app --reload
The backend will be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.Start the Frontend Server:In a second terminal, navigate to the frontend directory.Run the following command:npm run dev
The frontend application will be available at http://localhost:5173 (or the address provided in the terminal).Design Choices and AssumptionsArchitecture: I chose a decoupled full-stack architecture with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend. This is a modern, scalable approach that separates concerns and allows for independent development.Database: I used SQLite because it is simple, file-based, and requires no extra setup, making it ideal for a provisional product as specified. The backend is written using SQLAlchemy, which would allow for an easy transition to a more robust database like PostgreSQL in a production environment.State Management: Redux Toolkit was used for frontend state management to handle the application's global state (the list of events) in a predictable and scalable way.UI/UX: The design is centered around a wizard-style form for event creation. This is a critical design choice for a QMS, as it guides the user through a complex data entry process, ensuring data integrity and compliance.Implemented AI FeaturesThe AI Assistant is integrated into the main event dashboard. It uses the Gemini 1.5 Flash model to provide insights on the event data. First, create a few test events using the wizard, then use the AI Assistant to ask the following questions:FeaturePurposeExample QueryShow High-Risk EventsTo quickly identify the most critical open issues.Show me all the high-risk events.Summarize Open EventsTo provide a quick summary for managers or stand-ups.Summarize all open events.Suggest Next StepsTo provide guidance to users on how to proceed.What are the suggested next steps for event ID 1?Identify TrendsTo perform higher-level analysis on the QMS data.Are there any trends in our CAPA events?Generate Draft NotificationTo assist users with communication and documentation.Generate a draft notification for the closure of event ID 2.
